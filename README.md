# SUPLauncher | Reborn (UNOFFICIAL)
### V2.1.0

SUPLauncher contains plenty of features to enchance your experience on superiorservers, this was created for many reasons.

Another [sup launcher](https://github.com/Nicks-Alt/SUPLauncher) was released years ago, and has been discontinued since.

## Features:
* **Dupe Manager** - Import & delete dupes easily, with the dupe manager.
* **Overlay** - This overlay will be available once gmod is ran. Here you can change server, access dupe manager, lookup up profiles via steamid, and see your profile easily. With the overlay as well, any window opened within the overlay will start ontop of garrys mod. You can easily interact with these windows by opening the overlay again ***or*** if your on a sup server, you can press f3, to unlock your cursor. 
* **Staff easy profile lookup** - This can be easily enabled within the overlay. Whenever you copy a steamid there profile will be displayed in the top left (can be moved) and can display the player's PO's (Previous Offenses) by clicking on the expand button **or** using the keybinds that can be set in the settings menu.
* **AFK Mode** - A classic feature from the old sup launcher, you can set your garrys mod to be running in the background and stay connected to the server, this will use less resources as they will be no visuals and will stay in the background.
* **Sit Count** - You can view your sit count, this will be displayed on your normal profile (ONLY works on current logged in account), you will need to enable this by singing into your superiorservers account in the settings menu.
* **Automatic game content downloading** - When launching into a server, they will be checks to make sure you have the required content, only CSS (Counter Strike Source) textures are downloaded at the moment. Hoping to improve on this more in the future, but i need to know what files to download. 

**Planned features**
* More file checks when launching into a server. I would like to download all the sup content required. But i am not sure on what files in the garrys mod directory i need. So if anyone has a list, please msg me them on the forums and i can sort it out.
* Overlay (Direct X support) this would make the overlay a lot better, and instead of being a form on top of garrys mod, it would be drawn on the game.
